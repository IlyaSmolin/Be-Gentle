The face
And the lips
Tremble
As it rips
Your breath
Quickening
As heat
Rushes in

Pull harder
Strings martyr
Stop
You cry
That's a lie
Flush
Gasping
White
Reddening
You smile
And destroy it
It's time that we end this

It's our curse
That makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our
King to spead his genocidal wings

Clawing
The skin
Each kill
Your weakness
Annihilation
Your masturbation
Tyrant, i'll burn you down
Pull harder
Strings martyr
Stop
You cry
That's a lie
Flush
Gasping
White
Reddening
You smile
And destroy it
It's time that we end this

It's our curse
That makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our
King to spead his genocidal wings

It's our curse
That makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our
King to spead his genocidal wings

My hands grip your throat
I need your end
Burned, staked, ripped apart
I avenge
For every life you have taken
I am here to repay
You ask me "Oh God Why?"
'Cause i'm God that's fucking why
